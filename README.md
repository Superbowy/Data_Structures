# Data Structures

Data structures are indispensable for efficient programming.

I wanted to understand them better, so I recoded some of them from scratch in C++.

Currently, this includes:

- Array using malloc
- Vector (dynamic array)
- Doubly linked list
- Double-ended queue (implemented with a dll)
- Binary Search Tree
- Set (using a Red-Black Tree)
- Unordered map (hash map)
